• Title and Team members 
• [Section 1] Introduction – Briefly describe your project. 
• [Section 2] Methods – Describe your proposed ideas (e.g., features, design 
choices, algorithm(s), training overview, etc.) and your environment so that: 
o A reader can understand why you made your design decisions and the 
reasons behind any other choice related to the project. 
o A reader should be able to recreate your environment (e.g., conda list, 
conda envexport, etc.) 
o It may help to include a figure illustrating your ideas, e.g., a flowchart 
illustrating the steps in your machine learning system(s) 
• [Section 3] Experimental Design – Describe any experiments you conducted 
to demonstrate/validate the target contribution(s) of your project; indicate 
the following for each experiment: 
o The main purpose: 1-2 sentence high-level explanation 
o Baseline(s): describe the method(s) that you used to compare your 
work to. 
o Evaluation Metrics(s): which ones did you use and why? 
• [Section 4] Results – Describe the following: 
o Main finding(s): report your results and what you might conclude from 
your work. 
o Include at least one placeholder figure and/or table for 
communicating your findings. 
o All the figures containing results should be generated from the code. 
• [Section 5] Conclusions – List some concluding remarks. In particular: 
o Summarize in one paragraph the take-away point from your work. 
o Include one paragraph to explain what questions may not be fully 
answered by your work as well as natural next steps for this direction 
of future work. 
2. A single notebook called “main.ipynb” with ALL the code used for the project. The 
notebook must have the following characteristics: 
• Text and code cells must alternate from start to finish. The text cell above 
must describe the contents of the code below and its output so that a reader 
can easily follow up on your implementation. In particular: 
o You must explain what you will do and why you chose to do so. 
o You must explain the outputs of the cell (if any) with particular 
attention to describing figures such that a reader already knows 
what he is going to see.
